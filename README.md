# GHWT: Definitive Edition Launcher++
An upgraded launcher for Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition!

**IMPORTANT:** In its current state, this program isn't 100% functional. It will be ready by the time V1.0.4 of WTDE is released!

Here's some of its features:
- An entire graphical editor for just about every INI setting there is for WTDE, along with detailed and concise descriptions of each option and what it does.
- Actually lets you remap your keyboard controls! No more icky AspyrConfig! Yay!
- Update your config, the mod itself, and create a shortcut to the game all in the same window.
- And more features will be coming soon!

Things left to do:
- Merge all config loading into a single function.
- Finish adding options to the Graphics and Debug Settings tabs.
- Write the save configuration system fully. AspyrConfig saving for keyboard mapping strings is working!
