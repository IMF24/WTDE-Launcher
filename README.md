# GHWT: Definitive Edition Launcher++
An upgraded launcher for Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition!

Here's some of its features:
- An entire graphical editor for just about every INI setting there is for WTDE, along with detailed and concise descriptions of each option and what it does.
- Actually lets you remap your keyboard controls! No more icky AspyrConfig! Yay!
- Update your config, the mod itself, and create a shortcut to the game all in the same window.
- And more features will be coming soon!

Things left to do:
Nothing for now!
