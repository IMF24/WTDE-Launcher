            üì¶ - GHWT:DE 1.2.0.0, the BH5 Update, has been released! - üì¶
            <br>
            üìñ ‚îÄ About ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
            <br>
            The Band Hero 5 update is not a comprehensive "finalized" update like Vantallica, but this marks the first public release of our Guitar Hero 5 / Band Hero venues. 
            <br>
            Most of these venues are in a beta stage, but can still be played!
            <br>
            Beta venues are selectable in Quickplay Options, but will NOT be picked in random venue selection.
            <br><br>
            Alongside the work-in-progress venues are two venues that we consider "final" and finished:
            <br>
            üé™ - Sideshow (z_freakshow)
            <br>
            üóº - Harajuku  (z_tokyo)
            <br><br>
            üóíÔ∏è ‚îÄ Features ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
            <br>
            A complete and comprehensive changelog of all features will be posted below, but here are some of the highlights:
            <br><br>
            üíæ Modular .car file system for saved rockers
            <br><br>
            Saved rockers are no longer stored in the save file! Each rocker will be stored in the save folder to a .car file. Not only is this safer for corruption and backups, but you can now share your rockers to others!
            <br>
            üé• Cam Pulse
            <br><br>
            The cam pulse functionality from Guitar Hero: Metallica and onwards is now in WTDE! No need to re-download songs, all songs available that support it will now work properly. Enjoy camera zooms!
            <br>
            üíª Launcher Fixes
            <br><br>
            1.2.0.0 marks the biggest launcher update yet! IMF24's launcher is now at version 2.2 and contains A LOT of new features!
            <br>
            üí° Spotlight Flares
            <br><br>
            Flares are fixed at long last! Light housings have an improved look, and even have selectable versions from Guitar Hero III in the menu!
            <br>
            üì¶ And much more!
            <br><br>
            More characters, settings, features, improvements, and content! Enjoy!
            <br><br>

            üì¶ <b>GHWT:DE 1.1.1.0 has been released!</b> üì¶
            <br>
            A <b>BIG</b> update has just dropped, with lots to offer!
            <br><br>
            - üíø <b>Completely rewritten</b> mod loader, loads mods much faster!
            <br>
            - üé∏ Lots of GH3 instruments, and <b>Xavier Stone</b>!
            <br>
            - üíª <b>LOTS</b> of launcher fixes, and new features!
            <br><br>
            <b>üéµ  ‚Äî Song Notice ‚Äî üéµ</b>
            <br>
            Part of the song loader rewrite involves faster song analyzing and caching. <b>GHWTDE 1.1.1.0</b> fundamentally changes the way that hashes are calculated for songs!
            <br><br>
            ‚ùì <b>Why does this matter?</b> ‚ùì
            <br>
            - In order to make sure that online setlists and songs are in sync, each song has a unique checksum value based on the contents of its .pak file.
            <br>
            - Songs in 1.1.1.0 and later will have <b>DIFFERENT CHECKSUMS</b> than previous versions!
            <br>
            - You will NOT be able to play custom songs online with members on older versions!
            <br><br>
            üìÅ Will this change how mods are handled? üìÅ
            <br>
            NO, this will not change the way that YOU as a user interact with mods! Handle your mods the same way that you have been!
            <br>
            - Mods will be installed the same way, by placing them in DATA/MODS
            <br>
            - Song checksums for AutoPlay and charters will remain the same, and tutorials should stay the same (for now)
            <br><br>
            üéâ <b>Update your mod, and enjoy!</b> üéâ

            The mod loader is in the process of being <b>completely rewritten</b> from scratch! This will take some time (not a ton) but will provide benefits like:
            <br><br>

            <h6><b>Much faster mod loading</b></h6>
            - Mods should (hopefully) load a lot faster!
            <br>
            - GHWTDE.dll and the game will now speak back and forth as little as possible
            <br>
            - Logic changes in the update loop to hopefully make the process smoother
            <br><br>

            <h6><b>ScriptMod improvements</b></h6>
            - .qb files in ScriptMods can now be loaded recursively!
            <br>
            - DATA/MODS/MyMod/LevelA/LevelB/CodeFile.qb.xen works!
            <br>
            - .qb files no longer need to be named the same as the folder they are in
            <br>
            - _Load functions in the .qb file will be prefixed with the name of the .qb file (see above)
            <br><br>

            <h6><b>Cleaner Backend</b></h6>
            - Cleaner DLL source code allows for easy addition of future mod types
            <br><br>

            <h6><b>Mod Limit</b></h6>
            - Mod loading uses <b>dynamic</b> values and is no longer restricted to a static list
            <br>
            - Theoretically infinite mod count (no longer restricted to 30,000 or so)
            <br><br>

            <b>Stay tuned!</b>
            <br><br>

            <b>NO, nothing will change with installing mods or the way YOU interact with mods. This is an engine cleanup and will only improve your experience!</b>

    <h5>February 24, 2023 - New Launcher Announcement</h5>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size: 11px;">
            <i>Author: IMF24</i>
            <br>
            With version 1.1 of GHWT: DE still in very active development, there's also something else that has been in active development: a new and improved launcher -- the GHWT: DE Launcher++! It has (almost) every feature that the original launcher had, and a lot more on top of it. And by popular demand, keyboard remapping is a thing in this launcher!
            <br>
            Some of you might be asking, "Is this going to replace the current launcher?" The answer is no! Uzis's launcher will still be in your GHWT installation folders, and in 1.1, this one will be alongside it if you choose to use it.
            <br>            
            In light of this, I'm looking for some beta testers to give this launcher a try, and help me iron out anymore bugs and/or crashes by reporting anything you find wrong to me. Your feedback and bug reports would be much appreciated!
            <br>
            Should you encounter any bugs, report them to me (@IMF24 the Launcher Wizard ‚Ñ¢) in the #wtde-help-line channel in the Discord server or report them on the GitHub page.
            <br>
            Here's the first beta release; have fun! (download link removed for bug testing)
            <br>
            IF YOU HAD ANY PREVIOUS BETA RELEASE, PLEASE USE BETA RELEASE 4!

            Hotfix updates are likely to follow, but 1.0.3 is LIVE and ready for download! A few notes about this release:
            <br>
            - 1.0.3 is now on the main branch of GHWT:DE, which means it is no longer a beta! Moving forward, updates should be for everyone!
            <br>
            - Online play options are enabled by default now, no more INI changes!
            <br>
            - A launcher is included for easy configuration tweaks!
            <br>

            Song .pak verification has been added in the latest private developer release and is being tested, this means:
            <br>
            - Two people may have a song with the aceofspades checksum, but one person has the GH1 version and one person has the GHM version
            <br>
            - Pak integrity will be verified and this song will not show in the setlist, due to the two being different
            <br>
            Ideally at this point, people should NEVER be able to play a song that other players do not have! üß™ 
            <br>
            (More progress on this momentarily, this and custom character crash prevention SHOULD be fixed and online play should be safe to release very soon)

            - Hey all, We've decided to start fresh with a new repository for more content of Guitar Hero: World Tour - Definitive Edition! [Thanks Uzis, Show him some love!]
            <br>
            - We're re-converting previously broken songs with high quality charted arrangements of :bass: Bass, :drumstix: Drums and :vocals: Vocals for games that don't have them! And you don't have to download any extra categories for Hero-series related content at all! (DJ Hero Guitar Setlist is an example)
            <br>
            - Besides, there'll be ‚ú® EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ‚ú® from authorized modders for exclusive releases of their mods that want to show a little bit of extra love to our community. (Bit of a nice little feature, don't ya think?) We will also mirror all content we have out there as backup! (Psst! There's a custom venue there!)
            <br>
            - Oh, also there will be occasional announcements of the latest and greatest additions to our drive!
            <br>
            - Did I tell you that we also have Guitar Hero 3 PC with All DLC there? Thanks donnaken15!
            <br>
            üìÇ  The doors are open, go wild: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fK1R6gmLfPFlEf1LciXQ59B2Kd34dAmc">GHWT:DE</a>

All of your efforts are appreciated and will never go unnoticed! ‚ù§Ô∏è
            <br>
            IMPORTANT: It was reported to the dev team that there were issues with Clone's conversions, if you still have them; switch to the conversions that we have made! Those will be frequently updated and continue to have more features.
