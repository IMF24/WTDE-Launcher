            <br>
            With version 1.1 of GHWT: DE still in very active development, there's also something else that has been in active development: a new and improved launcher -- the GHWT: DE Launcher++! It has (almost) every feature that the original launcher had, and a lot more on top of it. And by popular demand, keyboard remapping is a thing in this launcher!
            <br>
            Some of you might be asking, "Is this going to replace the current launcher?" The answer is no! Uzis's launcher will still be in your GHWT installation folders, and in 1.1, this one will be alongside it if you choose to use it.
            <br>            
            In light of this, I'm looking for some beta testers to give this launcher a try, and help me iron out anymore bugs and/or crashes by reporting anything you find wrong to me. Your feedback and bug reports would be much appreciated!
            <br>
            Should you encounter any bugs, report them to me (@IMF24 the Launcher Wizard ™) in the #wtde-help-line channel in the Discord server or report them on the GitHub page.
            <br>
            Here's the first beta release; have fun! (download link removed for bug testing)
            <br>
            IF YOU HAD ANY PREVIOUS BETA RELEASE, PLEASE USE BETA RELEASE 4!

            ⚠️ NOTE: We have changed branches and the Updater will need to be modified! ⚠️ 
            <br>
            To make your Updater download from the main branch again:
            <br>
            - Open Updater.ini next to your Updater.exe, if you have already updated to 1.0.0 (or 1.0.2)
            <br>
            - Find the RepoBranch=beta line and remove it
            <br>
            - Save the file, and run the updater!
            <br>
            ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            <br>
            🧪 - This is an important update for all things updater and installer related! We will try to release a proper GHWT: DE "installer" soon which handles all of these issues, and more.

            <br>
            Song .pak verification has been added in the latest private developer release and is being tested, this means:
            <br>
            - Two people may have a song with the aceofspades checksum, but one person has the GH1 version and one person has the GHM version
            <br>
            - Pak integrity will be verified and this song will not show in the setlist, due to the two being different
            <br>
            Ideally at this point, people should NEVER be able to play a song that other players do not have! 🧪 
            <br>
            (More progress on this momentarily, this and custom character crash prevention SHOULD be fixed and online play should be safe to release very soon)

            <br>
            - Hey all, We've decided to start fresh with a new repository for more content of Guitar Hero: World Tour - Definitive Edition! [Thanks Uzis, Show him some love!]
            <br>
            - We're re-converting previously broken songs with high quality charted arrangements of :bass: Bass, :drumstix: Drums and :vocals: Vocals for games that don't have them! And you don't have to download any extra categories for Hero-series related content at all! (DJ Hero Guitar Setlist is an example)
            <br>
            - Besides, there'll be ✨ EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ✨ from authorized modders for exclusive releases of their mods that want to show a little bit of extra love to our community. (Bit of a nice little feature, don't ya think?) We will also mirror all content we have out there as backup! (Psst! There's a custom venue there!)
            <br>
            - Oh, also there will be occasional announcements of the latest and greatest additions to our drive!
            <br>
            - Did I tell you that we also have Guitar Hero 3 PC with All DLC there? Thanks donnaken15!
            <br>
            📂  The doors are open, go wild: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fK1R6gmLfPFlEf1LciXQ59B2Kd34dAmc">GHWT:DE</a>
            <br>
            Much love to AngelLeyend, Me, (won't you give me any love? 😸), huckleberrypie, Jake the Pandora Simp, Nevemind, RankGH159, rick, Oktoberfest, donnaken15 and many more precious people for contributing to the Drive! All of your efforts are appreciated and will never go unnoticed! ❤️
            <br>
            IMPORTANT: It was reported to the dev team that there were issues with Clone's conversions, if you still have them; switch to the conversions that we have made! Those will be frequently updated and continue to have more features.

            <br>
            Attached is a prototype Updater which will verify file integrity and update your GHWT:DE to the latest version of the BETA repository 🧪 
            <br>
            To use, follow README.txt included in the zip file 📖 
            <br>
            ────────────────────────────
            <br>
            Distribution will be slightly different from the next update forward and we are working actively on an installer which will install this updater and several other files (desktop shortcut!) to get started ⌛ 
            <br>
            Please remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS build of the next update but is mostly finished feature-wise, remember to report any issues in wtde-help-line as they arise
            <br>
            <i>GETTING VERIFICATION ERRORS?</i>
            <br>
            - Try running the Updater as admin, it may not have permissions to write to your game directory!
            <br>
            ────────────────────────────
            <br>
            (Verify that the main menu version is GHWT:DE 1.0.0 after update / installation)

            <b><i>REMEMBER:</i></b>

            <br>
            My Documents/My Games/Guitar Hero World Tour Definitive Edition
            <br>
            To use existing configuration files, move these files from your current game directory to this new permission-friendly location
